# OpenClaw Railway Template (1‑click deploy)

This repo packages **OpenClaw** for Railway with a small **/setup** web wizard so users can deploy and onboard **without running any commands**.

## What you get

- OpenClaw built from source (to avoid npm packaging gaps)
- A small Node wrapper server for Railway
- **Chromium installed in the runtime image** so OpenClaw's browser tooling can take screenshots/render pages when needed

- **OpenClaw Gateway + Control UI** (served at `/` and `/openclaw`)
- A friendly **Setup Wizard** at `/setup` (protected by a password)
- Persistent state via **Railway Volume** (so config/credentials/memory survive redeploys)
- One-click **Export backup** (so users can migrate off Railway later)
- **Import backup** from `/setup` (advanced recovery)
- **Persistent package manager caches** (for development: `pnpm` store, `npm` cache, and global packages survive container restarts)

## Development persistence

When developing in this container (e.g., working on projects in `/data/workspace`), package manager caches and global installs are automatically persisted to the Railway volume:

- **PNPM store**: `/data/pnpm-store` - Shared package cache for faster installs
- **PNPM home**: `/data/pnpm-home` - Global `pnpm` executables
- **NPM cache**: `/data/npm-cache` - `npm` package cache
- **NPM global**: `/data/npm-global` - Globally installed CLI tools

This means `npm install`, `pnpm install`, and global package installs (like `pnpm add -g typescript`) will persist across container restarts. You don't need to reinstall development tools every time.

**Note**: The first time you run `pnpm` or `npm` after a redeploy, it will repopulate the cache, but subsequent runs will be much faster as the cache is restored from the volume.

## How it works (high level)

- The container runs a wrapper web server.
- The wrapper protects `/setup` with `SETUP_PASSWORD`.
- During setup, the wrapper runs `openclaw onboard --non-interactive ...` inside the container, writes state to the volume, and then starts the gateway.
- After setup, **`/` is OpenClaw**. The wrapper reverse-proxies all traffic (including WebSockets) to the local gateway process.

## Railway deploy instructions (what you’ll publish as a Template)

In Railway Template Composer:

1) Create a new template from this GitHub repo.
2) Add a **Volume** mounted at `/data`.
3) Set the following variables:

Required:
- `SETUP_PASSWORD` — user-provided password to access `/setup`

Recommended:
- `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=/data/.openclaw`
- `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR=/data/workspace`

Optional:
- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` — if not set, the wrapper generates one (not ideal). In a template, set it using a generated secret.

Notes:
- This template pins OpenClaw to a known-good version by default via Docker build arg `OPENCLAW_GIT_REF`.

4) Enable **Public Networking** (HTTP). Railway will assign a domain.
5) Deploy.

Then:
- Visit `https://<your-app>.up.railway.app/setup`
- Complete setup
- Visit `https://<your-app>.up.railway.app/` and `/openclaw`

## Getting chat tokens (so you don’t have to scramble)

### Telegram bot token
1) Open Telegram and message **@BotFather**
2) Run `/newbot` and follow the prompts
3) BotFather will give you a token that looks like: `123456789:AA...`
4) Paste that token into `/setup`

### Discord bot token
1) Go to the Discord Developer Portal: https://discord.com/developers/applications
2) **New Application** → pick a name
3) Open the **Bot** tab → **Add Bot**
4) Copy the **Bot Token** and paste it into `/setup`
5) Invite the bot to your server (OAuth2 URL Generator → scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`; then choose permissions)

## Local smoke test

```bash
docker build -t openclaw-railway-template .

docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e PORT=8080 \
  -e SETUP_PASSWORD=test \
  -e OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=/data/.openclaw \
  -e OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR=/data/workspace \
  -v $(pwd)/.tmpdata:/data \
  openclaw-railway-template

# open http://localhost:8080/setup (password: test)
```
